2) Explain  the concept of closures in JavaScript. Provide an example where a closure might be useful.
It allows a function to access variables from its outer function  . 
A closure is formed when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function knows  the environment in which it was created.
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; 
  return function () {  
    count++; 
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = createCounter(); 
counter();
